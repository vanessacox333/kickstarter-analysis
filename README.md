# An Analysis on Kickstarter Campaign
## Overview of Project
### Analyses of theater kickstarter campaign outcomes based on launch date and goal amount. The theater subcategory "plays" were assessed based on the funding goal compared to actual amount pledged. Outcomes possible were categorized as either "successful," "failed," "canceled," or "live." Successful campaigns met their goal, failed campaigns did not meet their goal, canceled campaigns did not take place, and live campaigns are still in process. Furthermore, an assessment of all theater campaign outcomes was conducted based on launch date.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Success Based on Launch Date
The highest number of successful theater campaigns started in May (111) and June (100). The lowest number of successful theater campaigns started in November (54) and December (37).

### Success Based on Goal/Pledge Comparison 
The highest number of successful campaigns had a goal between $1,000-$4,999 and the highest number of failed campaigns had a goal of less than $1,000. Furthermore, campaigns with goals $20,000-$24,999, $25,000-$29,999, $30,000 to $34,999, $35,000 to $39,999, $40,000-$44,999, and $50,000+ had a 100% success rate.

### Difficulties/Challenges
One difficulty I ran into was that my Outcomes Based on Goal graph looked different than the example. This made me second guess the work I'd done, but then I checked with some classmates and they had been grappling with the same issue. The Bootcampspot data was not the same data we were given, so the graphs are different. Additionally, I was confused because it seems the instructions are also not up to date. For example, it talks about this excel file as if it's the same one we worked with in Bootcampspot. I have two excel files in this kickstarter-analysis repository: data-1-1-3-Starterbook which is what the weekly assignments wanted me to add to the repository, and the Kickstarter_Challenge which is the file for my Weekly Challenge.

Analysis and Challenges
The overview of the analysis is well described with screenshots (2 pt).
Challenges or difficulties that were encountered, and how they were overcome, are well explained. If there were no difficulties, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered (2 pt).
Results
Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date (2 pt).
One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals (2 pt).
There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for additional tables or graphs (2 pt).
